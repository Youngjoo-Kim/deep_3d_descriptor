# deep_3D_Feature

Code for the paper "Deep3DFeatures: Learning Local Feature Descriptors for 3D LiDAR Scans".
This package provides the code for training the model, all the training data and a learned model.
We also provide a c++ library for using the descriptor with PCL





## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

The package provides the code for the following things:

1. Learning a feature descriptor for 3D LiDAR scans
2. A library for using learned descriptor with PCL


###Files for learning the feature descriptor:


python_scripts/siamese.py: file used for training the deep neural network using TensorFlow

python siamese.py --filename --path_to_train_hdf5_file --path_to_test_hdf5_file
